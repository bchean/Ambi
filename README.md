Ambi
====

Ambi is a web app that acts as a dashboard for different sources of ambient noise. Inspired by [youarelistening.to](http://youarelistening.to), Ambi aims to provide a customizable passive-listening experience.

Noise sources include weather, police scanners, signal noise, and ambient locales (fireplace, beach, etc.). Users can also listen to SoundCloud and YouTube playlists. Sources can be mixed and matched to the user's preference. Noise compositions can be saved and shared.
